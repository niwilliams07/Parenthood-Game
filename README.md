# Parenthood Game
A simple game created by me and two friends to begin exploring the workings of unity in 2D. In this game, you play as a single dad and make choices that influence your daughter later in life. WE implemented a branching path mechanic along with multiple possible endings depending on the choices made. 

You can either download the file and click on build1 to play the game, or open the folder up with Unity to see how everything was done.
